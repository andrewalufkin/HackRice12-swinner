<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<div align="left">
  <p align="left">
    Fact: Corporate workers with children are <strong>BUSY</strong>.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    Fact: Professionals struggle with meal planning because they lack <strong>TIME</strong>.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    Fact: Meal planning should be <strong>AUTOMATED</strong>.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    Enter Swinners, an Android app to make meal planning easier than ever. After downloading the app and creating a free account, users are greeted with some preliminary questions:
    <ol>
      <li>What is your planned budget per meal?</li>
      <li>Do you have any dietary restrictions and/or allergies?</li>
      <li>Which cuisines do you like?</li>
      <li>How much time are you able to dedicate to cooking?</li>
    </ol>
    After establishing some basic parameters, users get access to thousands upon thousands of curated recipes. They swipe right or left to "favorite" or "skip" a recipe. Users can view directions to cook their favorite recipes, or even check out the ingredients to be delivered to their door.

<!-- OUR VISION -->
## Our Vision
<div align="left">
  <p align="left">
    We developed Swinner for the First Timers Track during HACKRICE 12. We focused on creating robust algorithms and good UI / UX during our time hacking. In the future, machine learning can improve the user experience tenfold, bringing them closer and closer to the perfect dinner. We hope you are as excited about our product as we are!
